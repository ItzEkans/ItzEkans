- 👋 Hi, I’m @ItzEkans!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, computer science, and Minecraft modding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Java programming language, pixel art, modeling, animation, and sound design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, but I have a few massive mod ideas I plan to work on someday that I may need some assistance with.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm itzekans on Discord and most other platforms.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: A single brain cell is in charge of all my logical thoughts 💪
